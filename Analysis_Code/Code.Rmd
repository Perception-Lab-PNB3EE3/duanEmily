## The Distribution of Reaction Times Between Conditions

    "Excited" = rgb(248/255, 118/255, 109/255, alpha = 0.7),  # Adjust alpha here

# Planned inferential stats

## Check Correlations Using One-way ANOVA

```{r}
# Measuring Correlation between Condition and ReactionTime
FirstDV_anova_result <- aov(ReactionTime ~ Condition, data = df)
summary(FirstDV_anova_result)

# Measuring Correlation between Condition and BetrayalChoices
SecondDV_anova_result <- aov(BetrayalChoices ~ Condition, data = df)
summary(SecondDV_anova_result)

# Conditions are significantly different in reaction time and BetrayalChoices  = yes main effect, hypotheses are proved.

# The type of music do affect people's choices, and also do affect people's reaction (thinking time).

```

## Post-hoc LSD Test on Reaction Times

```{r}
# Compute LSD post-hoc comparisons
lsd_results_RT <- emmeans(FirstDV_anova_result, pairwise ~ Condition, adjust = "none")

# Print LSD test results
print(lsd_results_RT)

# estimate = if positive, left > right; if negative, left < right.


# Significant

## Angry vs. Calm → Angry had significantly shorter reaction times

## Angry vs. Sad → Angry had significantly shorter reaction times

## Calm vs. Excited → Calm had significantly longer reaction times

## Excited vs. Sad → Excited had significantly shorter reaction times

# Not significant

## Angry vs. Excited → No significant difference in reaction times, suggesting both "Angry" and "Excited" conditions led to similar reaction times

## Calm vs. Sad → No significant difference in reaction times, suggesting both "Calm" and "Sad" conditions led to similar reaction times

## Tempo of bgm does influence the reaction time during decision games!

```

## Post-hoc LSD Test on Betrayal Choices

```{r}
# Compute LSD post-hoc comparisons
lsd_results_Choice <- emmeans(SecondDV_anova_result, pairwise ~ Condition, adjust = "none")

# Print LSD results
print(lsd_results_Choice)

# estimate = if positive, left > right; if negative, left < right.

# Significant
## Angry vs. Calm → Angry had significantly more betrayal choices

## Angry vs. Excited → Angry had significantly more betrayal choices

## Calm vs. Excited → Calm had significantly more betrayal choices

## Calm vs. Sad → Calm had significantly fewer betrayal choices

## Excited vs. Sad → Excited had significantly fewer betrayal choices

# Not significant
## Angry vs. Sad → This suggests that both "Angry" and "Sad" conditions led to similar betrayal choices.

## Valence of bgm does influence the choices during decision games!
