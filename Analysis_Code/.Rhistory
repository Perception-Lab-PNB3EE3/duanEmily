## Significant
# Angry vs. Calm → Angry had significantly shorter reaction times
# Angry vs. Sad → Angry had significantly shorter reaction times
# Calm vs. Excited → Calm had significantly longer reaction times
# Excited vs. Sad → Excited had significantly shorter reaction times
## Not significant
# Angry vs. Excited → No significant difference in reaction times, suggesting both "Angry" and "Excited" conditions led to similar reaction times

## Angry vs. Calm → Angry had significantly more betrayal choices
## Angry vs. Excited → Angry had significantly more betrayal choices
## Calm vs. Excited → Calm had significantly more betrayal choices
## Calm vs. Sad → Calm had significantly fewer betrayal choices
## Excited vs. Sad → Excited had significantly fewer betrayal choices
# Not significant
## Angry vs. Sad → This suggests that both "Angry" and "Sad" conditions led to similar betrayal choices.
