This folder is created for assignment 2, it contains:

the img file contains images (blue and orange shapes) to display in the "reactiontime.html" and "myNewExperiment.html" experiments.

the jspsych file that provides basic jspsych functions for both html files.

the "experiment.html" file is followed by the "hello_world" tutorial, it displays "hello world!" and disappears after hitting anywhere at the keyboard.

the "reactiontime.html" file is followed by the "reaction_time" tutorial, where it displays blue and orange circles repeatedly, and makes participants to click the assigned, corresponding keys as fast as possible. At the end of the experiment, it will give a feedback regarding how fast participantsâ€™ reaction times were for both colours of circles combined.

the "myNewExperiment.html" file is followed by the "reaction_time" tutorial, all test trials are same with "reactiontime.html" file, but it's altered to have:  
    (1) a smaller new size (half of the diameter) from the original orange circle, 
    (2) a blue square instead of a blue circle,
    (3) a new comparison of average RT (in ms) between blue square and orange circle.
